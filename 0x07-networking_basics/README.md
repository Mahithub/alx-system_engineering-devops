# Networking basics #0

This project was the first of two introducing networking concepts. In this
project, I answered a few quiz-like questions and wrote a couple bash scripts
while learning about the OSI model, LAN and WAN networks, and TCP/UDP data
transfer protocols.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

  * What is the OSI model?
    1. Set of specifications that network hardware manufacturers must respect
    2. The OSI model is a conceptual model that characterizes the communication
    functions of a telecommunication system without regard to their underlying
    internal structure and technology.
    3. The OSI model is a model that characterizes the communication functions
    of a telecommunication system with a strong regard for their underlying
    internal structure and technology.
